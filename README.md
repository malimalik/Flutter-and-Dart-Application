# Project Title
 Weekly-Expenses-App
 
 ## Tech/Framework used
 The project is created with 
 
 * Google's Dart Programming Language 
 * Google Flutter Framework

# Motivation 
The inspiration for this project comes from my curiosity to learn mobile app development. I wanted a way to create a cross platform app so that I would not have to write a seperate version for both the iOS and the Android version of the app. I found out about the Flutter framework through a Youtuber that I have been following and I realized that I could design and code beautiful material applications using the Flutter SDK. Of course, Flutter uses Dart as its programming language so I had to learn Dart as well. 

Fortunately, in my programming classes, I have had a good exposure to the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm and I was already familiar with Java and since Dart has a similar syntax to C and Java, it did not take me long to pick it up, afterall, once you understand the OOP concepts, picking up any object oriented language becomes easier. 

Since I am completely new to mobile app development, I wanted to test out the framework and the Flutter environment for my first basic app. I wanted to use all of the logic and the algorithmic thinking that I have been learning in class and expand on it. In my second programming class, we finished up the class by learning how to build Graphical User Interfaces using Java Swing and even though that was basic, it taught me all the tecnical details that lie under any user interface. This really peaked my interest and following my curiousity, I took on the new challenge to learn Dart to create user interfaces and apps with a new environment - Flutter.
